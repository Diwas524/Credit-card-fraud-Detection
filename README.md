The Credit Card Fraud Detection project is used to identify whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not by modeling past credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turned out to be fraud. We will use various predictive models to see how accurate they are in detecting whether a transaction is a normal payment or a fraud.

We are using the datasets provided by Kaggle. This data set includes all transactions recorded over the course of two days. As described in the dataset, the features are scaled and the names of the features are not shown due to privacy reasons.

The dataset consists of numerical values from the 28 ‘Principal Component Analysis (PCA)’ transformed features, namely V1 to V28. Furthermore, there is no metadata about the original features provided, so pre-analysis or feature study could not be done.
